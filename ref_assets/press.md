I no longer want to adapt the old application.  
I'd like to instead rewrite the entire thing. Help me implement the following idea:

Determine the most appropriate framework for a modern UI capable of both dark and light mode, optimized as a progressive web app. For iOS users in safari, I would like to implement, if available:

- Push notifications
- Vibration
- Gentle sound reminders

all configurable by the user

Purpose: A timer application for various coffee brewing methods.

There are steps for each part of the brewing cycle. Push notifications, vibrations, and sounds would prompt the user to start the next step.

I would like an intuitive UI to make recipes for this. A similar app has this style of recipe determined by JSON files such as v60.json in this dir.
